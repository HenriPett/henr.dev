              <span className='dropCap'>M</span>y name is Henrique. I'm a
              Brazilian Data Scientist. My passion for technology made me a
              self-taught programmer. At the beginning of 2020, my best friend
              Richard asked me what area I would like to start in the Tech
              field. Like many of the new developers my age, I've chosen AI. So
              Richard recommended me Python. After that day, I challenged myself
              to learn Python till the end of the year. But guess what, I was so
              excited that I learned in one month!
            </p>
            <p>
              After learning the main concepts of programming with Python, I
              started to go beyond that and learn about Data Science and
              Back-end development. A few months after, I joined research at my
              college about Machine Learning algorithms and learned a lot about
              statistics, data, and Neural networks. The research idea was to
              test machine learning algorithms in embedded systems and calculate
              their efficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
              After about half a year, I quit the research to enter one of the
              world's most prestigious Software Engineer courses at{' '}
              <a href='https://42.fr/en/homepage/'>Ã‰cole 42</a>. The course
              selection process is arduous. My class started with 12.000
              candidates and passed only 120 due to the high demand of time and
              effort in the process.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nowadays, I'm working as a Data Scientist at{' '}
              <a href='https://bom.capital/'>Bom</a>, and I'm learning how to
              struct a Data team in a company. It's a real challenge!
            </p>
            <p>
              My future goals consist of being a great Data Scientist/Machine
              learning Engineer and a professional problem solver. Be a part of
              Freelance projects and do whatever It's asked for a good problem
              solver.
