## My personal website

This is the code that runs on [henrip.dev](https://henrip.dev), where I try to express myself about technology and software deveploment.

I've used those tools for it:

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)

2. cd into the directory: `cd new-portfolio-website`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the client: `npm run dev`
